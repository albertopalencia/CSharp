# CSharp
This is a repository to study C# and .Net

## LotoFacil

This is a project where I consume an API of Lottery and create combinations to this Lottery Game.

## MongoDb

This project is a study about mongoDb.

## WebConfigChecker

This project checks if a .NET project has all keys on web.config.
I created this project because when I worked to decompose a service into microservices
some keys of the original project were forgotten in the new one.
So this project lists which keys do not exist.
